# BDD Automation Testing Project with C# using Selenium Webdrive with SpecFlow and MSTest

Overview
This repository contains an automation testing project implemented using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles with SpecFlow and MSTest. The project focuses on testing web applications using human-readable scenarios written in Gherkin syntax and translating them into executable test cases using C# and MSTest.

Key Components
Feature Files: Human-readable scenarios written in Gherkin syntax, outlining the behavior of the web application.
Step Definition Files: C# files containing the implementation of test logic for each step defined in the feature files.
Helper Methods (optional): Additional C# files with reusable methods to enhance code maintainability.
Technologies Used
BDD Framework: SpecFlow
Programming Language: C#
Testing Framework: MSTest
Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

FeatureFiles/: Contains the feature files written in Gherkin syntax.
StepDefinitions/: Contains the Step Definition files implementing the test logic for each step.
Helpers/ (optional): Contains helper methods used within Step Definition files for reusability.
TestResults/: Stores the test execution results.
README.md: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for execution.
Getting Started
To run the tests locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
